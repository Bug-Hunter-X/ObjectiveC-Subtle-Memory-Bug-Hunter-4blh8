The primary issue lies in how `myString` is handled. Using `retain` in the property declaration means the object takes ownership; hence you should use `release` in `dealloc`. However, if you were using `copy`, no explicit release is needed, as `copy` creates a new object. To correct it, consider using ARC or managing retain/release counts carefully.

Here's the corrected code (using ARC is recommended):

```objectivec
// Using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting)
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString; // Use 'strong' instead of 'retain'
@end

@implementation MyClass
// dealloc is no longer needed with ARC
@end

// Or if not using ARC:
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *myString; // Use 'copy' instead of 'retain'
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
  [super dealloc]; // only call super dealloc
}
@end
```

Using `copy` ensures that `myString` always holds a unique copy, eliminating the need for manual memory management.  Using ARC, which automatically manages retain counts, is always preferred if available.
